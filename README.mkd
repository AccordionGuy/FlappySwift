# The Flappening: "Flappy Bird" in Swift, fixed!

An implementation of Flappy Bird in Swift for iOS 8, originally written for pre-beta-7 Xcode 6 by:

- Nate Murray - [@eigenjoy](https://twitter.com/eigenjoy)
- Ari Lerner - [@auser](https://twitter.com/auser)
- Based on code by [Matthias Gall](http://digitalbreed.com/2014/how-to-build-a-game-like-flappy-bird-with-xcode-and-sprite-kit)

as part of their [Game Programming with Swift](https://fullstackedu.com) course.

With Xcode 6 beta 7 and subsequent versions, the [original version](https://github.com/fullstackio/FlappySwift) stopped working, as Apple changed a number of their APIs, including Sprite Kit, for optional conformance. I explain what happened and how to fix it in [this entry](http://www.globalnerdy.com/2014/09/25/why-your-swift-apps-broke-in-xcode-6-beta-7-and-the-gm-versions-and-how-to-fix-them/) on my tech blog, *[Global Nerdy](http://www.globalnerdy.com/),* and this repo houses FlappySwift with these fixes. Enjoy!
